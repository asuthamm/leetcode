Approach 3: Math in python
Concept

2 * (a + b + c) - (a + a + b + b + c) = c2∗(a+b+c)−(a+a+b+b+c)=c

class Solution(object):
    def singleNumber(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        return 2 * sum(set(nums)) - sum(nums)


Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n + n) = O(n). sum will call next to iterate through \text{nums}nums. We can see it as sum(list(i, for i in nums)) which means the time complexity is O(n) because of the number of elements(nn) in \text{nums}nums.

Space complexity : O(n + n) = O(n). set needs space for the elements in nums
